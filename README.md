# ML Models Evaluation and Selecting the Best One   
In this project, I wanted to know the best ML Model which will work for the given data set regarding admissions.   
# AutoML Using the LazyPredict Library
Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. 
It is the combination of automation and ML. AutoML potentially includes every stage from beginning with a raw dataset to building a machine learning model ready for deployment.    
# Technologies Used    
- Python   
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- LazyPredict
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Project Overview   
Evaluated and compared multiple machine learning models for regression using key metrics like R-Squared, Adjusted R-Squared, RMSE, and Time Taken. 
The goal was to select the best-performing model based on accuracy and efficiency.

# Approach:
- Utilized LazyPredict to apply various regression models and evaluate their performance.
- Normalized performance metrics and calculated a composite score for model comparison.
- Selected the best model based on accuracy and computational efficiency.
